# Conditional Statements

* Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true;
* Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false;
* Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
* Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.


### There are instructions that can determine the flow of an application 
### This makes software dynamic

### Conditional: else and alse if

* In case the ´if´ statement is negative, we can add ´else´;
* Another conditional will be executed;
* We can then create a fork in the code;
* The ´else if´ has the possibility to do another check and add another code block.
