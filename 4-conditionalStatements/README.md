### Conditional Statements

* Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true;
* Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false;
* Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
* Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.


## There are instructions that can determine the flow of an application 
## This makes software dynamic

## Conditional: else and alse if

* In case the ´if´ statement is negative, we can add ´else´;
* Another conditional will be executed;
* We can then create a fork in the code;
* The ´else if´ has the possibility to do another check and add another code block.


## Comparison and Logical Operators
# Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false.
## Assignment Operators

* They are commonly used to check dondition structures;
* We have the following operators: ==, !=, >,<, >=, <=;
* By adding this comparison empression we can get true or false.

## Value and data type comparison

*  Two other comparation operators exist in javascript: === and !==
* This compares the value and the data type
*
